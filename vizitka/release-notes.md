# Vizitka — Release Notes

Date: 2026-01-07

## What it is
- A minimal one-page online business card with contact information and lightweight styling.

## Files
- `vizitka/index.html` — page content and structure
- `vizitka/styles.css` — styling
- `vizitka/script.js` — small interactive bits (if any)

## Implemented
- Created a compact, responsive business card layout.
- Moved original site files into the `vizitka/` folder for separation from other prototypes.
- Deployed via GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch) so the page is publicly accessible.

## Remaining / Ideas
- Add a favicon and small image assets.
- Optional: add a contact form (with server-side handling or Formspree) to receive direct messages.
- Internationalization: add English/other language toggle.
- Accessibility check: run an a11y audit and fix issues.

## Developer notes
- Keep business-card-specific work inside `vizitka/`.
- Use the repository's `gh-pages` branch for quick static deployments.

## Documentation suggestions
- Add a short README in `vizitka/` describing how to edit contact details and deploy.
- Add a tiny checklist for release: update content, run accessibility check, verify on mobile.
