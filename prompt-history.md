# Prompt History (user prompts — verbatim going forward)

Date generated: 2026-01-07

NOTE: From this point onward I will record your prompts verbatim in this file after each interaction. Previous entries are kept as a summarized history below; if you want me to retroactively replace the summaries with exact, verbatim copies of all past messages, say so and I will update the file.

Summarized history of earlier prompts (pre-2026-01-07):

- Initial requests to create a one-page business card and then simplify it to a minimal card.
- Request to publish the site to GitHub Pages.
- Request to create a static wishlist prototype with 10 sample items.
- Move from URL-hash state to Supabase-backed persistence; user provided `SUPABASE_URL` and publishable key.
- Troubleshooting RLS SQL errors and fixing client-side issues (Supabase UMD detection and global naming collision).

Verbatim prompts (will be appended here after each of your messages):

1. Chci zaznamenávat přesné prompty.

--
I will append each new exact prompt automatically. If you want previous prompts added verbatim as well, confirm and I will replace the summarized section above with full verbatim history.
